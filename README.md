Executive Summary
The executive summary provides a good high-level view but could be strengthened by summarizing specific findings and recommendations. You might want to explicitly state the main conclusions about how domestic and international marketing strategies differ and the practical implications for companies.

Introduction
Clarify Definitions: Consider defining "home marketing" and "international marketing" more explicitly at the start to set a clear foundation for the discussion.
Objective: Clearly state the objective of the study. For example: "This study aims to analyze the key differences between home and international marketing, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach."

Critical Discussion of Arguments and Evidence
Structure: Break this section into sub-sections for clarity, such as "Complexity and Cost," "Consumer Preferences," "Regulatory Challenges," etc.
Evidence and Citations: Ensure that each argument is supported by relevant evidence and appropriately cited. For instance, you mention Kaleka and Morgan (2019) but don't fully integrate their findings into your discussion.
Identification of Key Positive and Negative Aspects
Table or Figures: Include tables or figures to visually represent the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of home vs. international marketing. This could enhance understanding.
Balance: Ensure that the positive and negative aspects are balanced and provide a nuanced view. For instance, you mention that international marketing faces challenges like higher costs and regulatory issues, but also highlight potential high profit margins and growth opportunities.

Relevance and Usefulness
Personal Insight: Your personal insights are valuable. Consider framing them more formally as part of your analysis. For example: "Based on my understanding and study, domestic marketing tends to be less risky due to familiar market conditions, whereas international marketing offers significant growth potential but comes with higher complexity and risk."

Limitations
Detail Limitations: Elaborate on the limitations. For instance, why is the lack of focus on service/product offerings a limitation? How might this affect the findings?

Conclusion
Summarize Findings: Restate the main findings of the study in a concise manner.
Recommendations: Provide clear recommendations for businesses based on the analysis. For example: "Companies should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of international marketing, considering their resources and market conditions."
